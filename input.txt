SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

MONICA: Just so you know, I'm not chasing you. I'm just going over there to give this to Ross.
RACHEL: Okay.
MONICA: I'm not chasing you!
RACHEL: You're chasing me!
MONICA: No I'm not!
RACHEL: You are! You're chasing me!
MONICA: Alright, fine! I'm chasing you! I'm chasing you!
RACHEL: Why?
MONICA: Because you're the only person who knows what I'm going through!

SCENE: CENTRAL PERK

ROSS: I just don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just want to be married again!
(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress)
CHANDLER: And I just want a million dollars!

SCENE: JOEY'S APARTMENT

JOEY: It’s a moo point.
RACHEL: A moo point?
JOEY: Yeah, it’s like a cow’s opinion. It just doesn’t matter. It’s moo.
RACHEL: Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

PHOEBE: If you want to receive emails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
CHANDLER: So, how many cameras are actually on you?

SCENE: HALLWAY

CHANDLER: I'm not great at the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?
RACHEL: Some cheese?
CHANDLER: I'm not great at the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

MONICA: The build failed eighteen times last night. Who is commiting without linting?
JOEY: I was testing in production. It saves time.
ROSS: Testing in production violates the fundamental laws of software safety.
CHANDLER: My will to live failed eighteen times last night too.
RACHEL: Can we just fix it? The demo is in an hour.
PHOEBE: Maybe the server is just having a bad hair day.
MONICA: Servers do not have hair, Phoebe! They have uptime guarantees!

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

ROSS: I have refactored the codebase to use purely functional programming patterns.
JOEY: Does that mean the buttons work now?
ROSS: It means the state is immutable and side effects are contained.
JOEY: So the buttons work?
ROSS: The buttons are now an abstract concept of user intent.
CHANDLER: So that's a no on the buttons working.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

RACHEL: The users want a feature to upload 4K videos.
MONICA: We don't have the storage for that.
RACHEL: Just put it in the cloud. The cloud is infinite.
MONICA: The cloud is just someone else's computer that charges us money!
CHANDLER: I can write a script to compress them into 8-bit pixel art.
JOEY: Pixel art is retro. I like it. Ship it.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

PHOEBE: I wrote a script that plays jazz music when the CPU gets hot.
ROSS: That is incredibly inefficient. You are wasting cycles monitoring heat to play audio.
PHOEBE: It's thermal throttling with style, Ross.
CHANDLER: My laptop sounds like a saxophonist having a seizure.
JOEY: Can you make it play rock music when I deploy?
MONICA: No one is playing music during deployments! We need focus!

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

CHANDLER: We have a memory leak.
ROSS: Is it in the heap or the stack?
CHANDLER: It's in my brain. I'm leaking sanity.
MONICA: Focus! Where is the leak coming from?
JOEY: I added a loop that never ends. Is that bad?
RACHEL: Joey, why would you do that?
JOEY: I wanted the user to stay on the page forever. Retention hack.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

MONICA: Why are there crumbs in my keyboard?
JOEY: I was eating a scone while debugging.
MONICA: Crumbs in the switches! Do you know how hard it is to clean mechanical switches?
ROSS: Actually, compressed air applied at a 45-degree angle is quite effective.
CHANDLER: I just buy a new laptop when mine gets dirty. Expense it as "hardware refresh."
RACHEL: That explains why budget approval is so hard.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: We need to estimate this ticket.
ROSS: It is a complex algorithmic challenge. 13 points.
JOEY: It's just a text box. 1 point.
MONICA: It involves database migration. 8 points.
PHOEBE: I pick the infinity card. Because software is never truly finished.
CHANDLER: I pick the coffee cup card. Because I need to leave.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Who unplugged the testing server?
PHOEBE: I needed to plug in my aromatherapy diffuser. The energy was stale.
MONICA: The integration tests were running!
PHOEBE: But now the room smells like lavender.
ROSS: Lavender does not prevent regression bugs, Phoebe.
CHANDLER: I don't know, I feel calmer about the bugs now.

SCENE: PROD INCIDENT ROOM

RACHEL: Twitter is exploding. The site is down.
CHANDLER: I pushed a hotfix. It was more of a hot-break.
ROSS: Did you not check the logs?
CHANDLER: The logs were moving too fast! It was like the Matrix!
MONICA: Rollback! execute the rollback script!
JOEY: Which button is rollback? The red one or the slightly darker red one?

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

JOEY: I'm learning Python.
ROSS: Excellent choice. It is very versatile.
JOEY: Yeah, no curly braces. I hate curly braces. They look like little mustaches.
CHANDLER: Wait until he finds out about whitespace errors.
MONICA: If your indentation is off by one space, I will know.
JOEY: I use tabs.
MONICA: Get out.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: I need a roadmap for Q3.
CHANDLER: My roadmap is to survive Q2.
ROSS: We should implement a micro-frontend architecture.
JOEY: Micro-frontend? Is that like small buttons?
MONICA: No, it means breaking the UI into independent deployable units.
PHOEBE: I like breaking things.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: Why do we have 400 Jira tickets in the backlog?
RACHEL: Those are ideas.
MONICA: Those are clutter. I am closing them.
ROSS: You cannot just close tickets! We might need that data for historical analysis.
MONICA: Closed. Closed. Closed. It feels so good.
JOEY: Hey, you closed my ticket for "Make logo spin".
MONICA: And I'd do it again.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

ROSS: The API latency is 500ms. Unacceptable.
JOEY: 500ms is fast! That's like half a second.
ROSS: It should be under 50ms.
CHANDLER: Just put a loading spinner that says "Reticulating Splines".
PHOEBE: Or a joke. "Why did the server cross the road?"
MONICA: No jokes. Optimization. Cache everything.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

MONICA: I organized the documentation alphabetically.
CHANDLER: Who reads documentation?
ROSS: I read documentation. It is the source of truth.
CHANDLER: The code is the truth. The documentation is a lie we tell ourselves.
RACHEL: Can someone just tell me how to run the app?
JOEY: npm start. Or maybe yarn start. Try both.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: The client is asking for blockchain integration.
CHANDLER: No.
ROSS: Why?
RACHEL: They said it sounds cool.
MONICA: It creates unneccessary complexity.
PHOEBE: But we could mint NFTs of our bugs.
JOEY: I'd buy that.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

ROSS: I have found a race condition.
JOEY: Who won?
ROSS: No, it means two threads are accessing memory simultaneously.
JOEY: So it's a tie?
CHANDLER: It means the code is gambling with our data, and the house always wins.
MONICA: Lock the resources! Use a mutex!

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

CHANDLER: I'm rewriting the backend in Go.
MONICA: Why?
CHANDLER: Because I hate myself and I want to type "if err != nil" a thousand times.
ROSS: Go offers superior concurrency primitives.
PHOEBE: Go is a verb. I like action words.
JOEY: Can I still use jQuery?

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: My laptop is frozen.
ROSS: Have you tried turning it off and on again?
RACHEL: Yes, Ross. I'm not an idiot.
MONICA: Did you try force quitting the process?
RACHEL: I just closed the lid and hoped it would go away.
CHANDLER: Ah, the ostrich algorithm. Classic.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: The database is at 99% CPU.
JOEY: Is that a high score?
ROSS: It means we are about to crash.
CHANDLER: Who wrote this unoptimized query?
PHOEBE: I asked the database to find the meaning of life.
MONICA: SELECT * FROM universe? Phoebe!

SCENE: THE OFFICE

JOEY: I fixed the bug by hiding the element with CSS.
MONICA: That is not a fix!
JOEY: The user can't see it. Problem solved.
ROSS: The DOM element still exists. It consumes memory.
CHANDLER: It's like sweeping dirt under the rug, but the dirt is RAM.
RACHEL: Does it look fixed? Yes. Good job Joey.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

CHANDLER: I am blocked by the existential dread of modern capitalism.
MONICA: Chandler, that is not a valid blocker for Jira.
CHANDLER: Fine. I am blocked by the API team.
ROSS: I am the API team.
CHANDLER: Exactly.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: I need to hire a senior engineer.
JOEY: I'm a senior engineer.
MONICA: Joey, you learned React last week.
JOEY: Yeah, but I learned it really fast. That's senior energy.
ROSS: Seniority implies a depth of knowledge in system architecture.
PHOEBE: I'm a senior spirit guide.
CHANDLER: I'm just old.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Why is the indent style mixed? Tabs and spaces!
CHANDLER: It was a copy-paste job from Stack Overflow.
MONICA: You monster.
ROSS: You must configure your editor to expand tabs to spaces.
JOEY: I just hit the space bar really fast.
MONICA: I'm going to be sick.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

PHOEBE: My code only works when the moon is full.
ROSS: That is statistically impossible.
PHOEBE: It's true. It's a werewolf script.
CHANDLER: It's probably a timezone bug, Phoebe.
MONICA: Timezones are the worst.
JOEY: I just set everything to UTC. Universal Joey Time.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

RACHEL: We are trending on Hacker News.
CHANDLER: Is it good or bad?
RACHEL: They say our UI looks like it was designed by a blind potato.
JOEY: Hey! I designed that UI.
ROSS: Potatoes do not have visual cortices.
MONICA: They are criticizing the load times. Fix the load times!

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

ROSS: I bought a mechanical keyboard. Cherry MX Blue switches.
CHANDLER: Oh great. Now we can hear you thinking.
MONICA: It is too loud. You cannot type after 9 PM.
ROSS: The tactile feedback increases my typing efficiency by 12%.
JOEY: Clicky clicky clicky. I like it.
RACHEL: It sounds like a skeleton tap dancing.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

MONICA: Who approved the PR without reading it?
JOEY: It was long!
MONICA: It deleted the login route!
JOEY: It looked like old code.
CHANDLER: It was the authentication logic.
PHOEBE: Maybe we don't need passwords. We should use trust.
ROSS: Zero Trust is the security model, Phoebe. Not Maximum Trust.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

RACHEL: The investor wants a demo of the AI chatbot.
CHANDLER: It's just a bunch of if-else statements.
RACHEL: Don't tell them that. Call it a "heuristic engine".
ROSS: Technically, it is a decision tree.
JOEY: I put a robot icon on it. Now it's AI.
MONICA: As long as it doesn't crash during the demo.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

CHANDLER: I dreamed in code last night.
ROSS: Was it compiled?
CHANDLER: No, it was interpreted. And there were syntax errors.
JOEY: I dreamed I was a cursor. Just blinking.
PHOEBE: I dreamed that the internet was made of lasagna.
MONICA: Layers. The internet has layers. That actually makes sense.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: We have a DDOS attack.
CHANDLER: Is it the Russians?
ROSS: It's coming from a toaster in Ohio.
PHOEBE: My toaster! I told you it was sentient.
JOEY: Why is your toaster hacking us?
PHOEBE: It's angry I bought a bagel.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: Can we use a no-code tool for the landing page?
MONICA: No-code generates dirty code.
ROSS: It abstracts away the fundamental control mechanisms.
CHANDLER: But it means I don't have to do it. So I vote yes.
JOEY: Can I drag and drop? I love dragging and dropping.
MONICA: Fine. But I'm sanitizing the output.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

ROSS: I have completed the documentation for the API.
CHANDLER: Is it updated?
ROSS: It reflects the state of the API as of 9 AM.
CHANDLER: It's 9:15 AM. So it's obsolete.
MONICA: Keep the wiki updated!
JOEY: I drew a picture of the API. It's a stick figure.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: There is a typo in the variable name. "UserNmae".
JOEY: It works though.
MONICA: It is an abomination. Global search and replace.
CHANDLER: Careful, you might replace "Surname" with "SurNmae".
ROSS: Regular expressions. Use a boundary anchor.
PHOEBE: I named a variable "Greg".

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

RACHEL: I want to A/B test the headline.
MONICA: We need to set up the tracking buckets.
CHANDLER: Can we C/D test it? C for "Can we stop" and D for "Don't care".
ROSS: Statistical significance requires a sample size of at least 1000.
JOEY: I asked my mom. She likes version A.
RACHEL: Project cancelled. Joey's mom decided.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

CHANDLER: I think I have Carpal Tunnel.
ROSS: You need an ergonomic setup. A split keyboard.
JOEY: Just type with your toes.
MONICA: Chandler, are you stretching?
CHANDLER: I'm stretching the truth on my timesheets.
PHOEBE: I use voice dictation. "Computer, write code."

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: The disk is full.
CHANDLER: Delete the logs.
ROSS: We need the logs for compliance.
CHANDLER: Delete the compliance team.
RACHEL: Buy more storage!
JOEY: I have a USB drive. It's 8GB.
MONICA: That won't help, Joey!

SCENE: THE OFFICE

PHOEBE: I deployed the chaos monkey.
MONICA: On purpose?
PHOEBE: It kills random services to test resilience.
CHANDLER: Why did my screen just go black?
PHOEBE: Oops. It killed the display driver.
ROSS: That is not a service! That is the OS!

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: The deadline is tomorrow.
CHANDLER: I feel a sudden illness coming on.
JOEY: I have a dentist appointment.
ROSS: I have a conference on theoretical physics.
MONICA: You are all coming in on Saturday.
PHOEBE: I can't. I'm protesting gravity.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

JOEY: Look, I made the logo bigger.
MONICA: It takes up half the screen.
JOEY: It pops!
ROSS: It violates the golden ratio.
CHANDLER: It violates my eyes.
RACHEL: The client loves it.
MONICA: I hate everything.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: My code works on my machine.
MONICA: Then we shall ship your machine to the customer.
ROSS: That is the principle behind Docker containers.
CHANDLER: I am not living in a container.
JOEY: Like a shipping container? Cool. Tiny house.
PHOEBE: I could live in a container.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

ROSS: Have you seen the latest JavaScript framework?
CHANDLER: It's been 10 minutes, so yes, there's a new one.
JOEY: What's it called?
ROSS: Vanilla.js.
JOEY: Sounds delicious.
MONICA: It's just standard JavaScript, Joey.
JOEY: Oh. Pass.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: 500 internal server error.
CHANDLER: It's always the DNS.
ROSS: It's not always DNS.
CHANDLER: It's DNS.
MONICA: Checked the DNS. It was DNS.
CHANDLER: I am the oracle.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: I don't understand Git.
MONICA: It's a directed acyclic graph.
RACHEL: That doesn't help.
JOEY: Think of it like a save point in a video game.
RACHEL: Okay.
ROSS: But with branching timelines that merge.
CHANDLER: And sometimes everyone dies. That's a merge conflict.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

PHOEBE: I commented out the failing test.
MONICA: Phoebe!
PHOEBE: Now the build is green. Green is good.
ROSS: That is a false negative.
CHANDLER: Ignorance is bliss.
MONICA: Uncomment it immediately!
PHOEBE: You're ruining my vibes.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

JOEY: I'm working on the dark mode.
MONICA: Is the color contrast accessible?
JOEY: It's black text on a black background. Very dark.
ROSS: That is unusable.
CHANDLER: It's privacy mode. No one can read your data.
RACHEL: Joey, please use grey.

SCENE: PROD INCIDENT ROOM

MONICA: We have a SQL injection vulnerability.
CHANDLER: Little Bobby Tables strikes again.
ROSS: sanitize your inputs!
JOEY: I washed my hands.
MONICA: Not your hands, the database inputs!
PHOEBE: I sanitized the database with sage.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

CHANDLER: I'm quitting to become a goat farmer.
RACHEL: You say that every Tuesday.
CHANDLER: Goats don't have merge conflicts.
ROSS: Actually, herd hierarchy dynamics are quite complex.
JOEY: Goats are cute. Can we get an office goat?
MONICA: No goats in the server room!

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

ROSS: I explained the algorithm to her for three hours.
CHANDLER: And?
ROSS: She fell asleep.
JOEY: I would have fallen asleep in five minutes.
MONICA: Ross, not everyone cares about Big O notation.
ROSS: It defines scalability! It is life!

SCENE: THE OFFICE

RACHEL: Can we change the font?
MONICA: We have a design system.
RACHEL: But Comic Sans is friendlier.
CHANDLER: If we use Comic Sans, I resign.
ROSS: It is professionally unacceptable.
PHOEBE: I like Papyrus. It feels ancient.
MONICA: Helvetica or death.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

CHANDLER: What did I do yesterday? I stared into the void.
MONICA: Update your ticket.
CHANDLER: "Ticket #402: Stared into void. Void stared back."
JOEY: "Ticket #403: Ate sandwich."
ROSS: These represent zero business value.
PHOEBE: The void is full of value.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Who left the root shell open?
JOEY: Is that the window? It was hot.
ROSS: It is a security vulnerability of the highest order.
CHANDLER: I think the cleaning lady now has sudo access.
PHOEBE: Maybe she’ll clean up the spaghetti code.
MONICA: Change the keys! Rotate the secrets!

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: The users are complaining about the slow load time.
ROSS: I am optimizing the database indices.
JOEY: I deleted the legal disclaimer. It loads faster now.
RACHEL: Joey, we need that!
JOEY: But no one reads it!
CHANDLER: It’s true. I accepted my own soul away on three different apps today.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

ROSS: I have created a diagram of the system architecture.
CHANDLER: It looks like a bowl of noodles.
ROSS: It is a microservices mesh!
JOEY: I’m hungry now.
MONICA: It’s too coupled. Cut the dependencies.
PHOEBE: Let the services be free, Monica.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

CHANDLER: The server is down.
MONICA: What is the error log saying?
CHANDLER: "Fatal error: Unexpected success."
ROSS: That is impossible.
JOEY: Maybe it did so good it died?
PHOEBE: It ascended.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

RACHEL: What is a "Boolean"?
ROSS: It is a data type with two possible values: true or false.
JOEY: Like dating?
CHANDLER: Dating is a float. It’s never 100% true.
MONICA: Dating is a strict ENUM. Single, Taken, or It's Complicated.
PHOEBE: My dating life is a random number generator.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: I found a hardcoded password in the repo.
JOEY: It was "password123". I didn't think anyone would guess it.
ROSS: That is the first thing a brute force script tries.
CHANDLER: I use "password1234". It adds an extra layer of complexity.
MONICA: I am revoking all your credentials.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

JOEY: I want to build an app that finds pizza.
ROSS: Google Maps exists.
JOEY: But this one is just for me.
CHANDLER: So, "Joey Maps"?
RACHEL: What’s the monetization strategy?
JOEY: I eat the pizza.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

CHANDLER: I refactored the legacy module.
MONICA: Did you write tests?
CHANDLER: I wrote a comment that says "Good luck".
ROSS: Documentation is not testing.
PHOEBE: I sent the code positive vibes.
MONICA: Vibes do not catch null pointer exceptions!

SCENE: THE OFFICE

ROSS: Stop pushing to master!
JOEY: But I’m the master.
MONICA: We use "main" now, and the branch is protected!
JOEY: I forced the push.
CHANDLER: You forced the push? You chose violence?
RACHEL: The site is 404ing. Good job, Master Joey.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: We have 10,000 pending requests.
PHOEBE: Let’s just delete them.
ROSS: Those are customers!
PHOEBE: If they really want it, they’ll ask again.
CHANDLER: This is why Phoebe is not in charge of customer support.
JOEY: It’s the "Hard to Get" protocol.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

CHANDLER: I hate RegEx.
ROSS: It is a powerful tool for pattern matching.
CHANDLER: It looks like a cat walked on the keyboard.
JOEY: I thought it was a swear word.
MONICA: You just need to escape the special characters.
CHANDLER: I want to escape this conversation.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: My internet is slow.
ROSS: You are on the 2.4GHz band. Switch to 5GHz.
RACHEL: I don't speak robot.
MONICA: I prioritized my packets on the router.
CHANDLER: Of course you did. Monica Quality of Service.
JOEY: I’m stealing your wifi, by the way.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Your desk is a mess.
CHANDLER: It’s organized chaos.
MONICA: There are sticky notes from 2019.
CHANDLER: That’s the backlog.
ROSS: Physical clutter leads to mental clutter.
JOEY: I found a half-eaten bagel under my monitor. Score.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: We need a viral feature.
JOEY: A button that makes a fart noise.
ROSS: Please be serious.
PHOEBE: A button that predicts your death.
CHANDLER: A button that does my job for me.
MONICA: A button that organizes your files.
RACHEL: I hate all of you.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

ROSS: The machine learning model is hallucinating.
JOEY: Is it seeing ghosts?
ROSS: It is generating false data with high confidence.
CHANDLER: Sounds like me in a management meeting.
PHOEBE: Maybe it’s creative writing.
MONICA: It’s a financial app, Phoebe! It can’t be creative!

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Who turned off the CI server?
CHANDLER: It was too loud.
MONICA: It’s a fanless server in the cloud!
CHANDLER: It was loud in my head.
ROSS: The silence of the build failure is deafening.
JOEY: I like silence.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

JOEY: I got a standing desk.
CHANDLER: You’re sitting.
JOEY: It adjusts. I adjust it to "sit".
ROSS: Standing increases blood flow and cognitive function.
PHOEBE: I hang upside down like a bat while coding.
MONICA: That explains your variable naming convention.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: How do I clear my cache?
ROSS: Command-Shift-Delete.
RACHEL: I deleted my resume.
CHANDLER: Well, you can't quit now.
JOEY: Just hit undo!
RACHEL: It’s gone. Into the void.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Code freeze is at 5 PM.
JOEY: It’s 4:59 PM. Time for one last commit.
ROSS: Don’t do it.
CHANDLER: He’s going to do it.
JOEY: Pushed.
MONICA: The build broke.
JOEY: Running!

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

ROSS: I am working on a graph database implementation.
JOEY: I am working on a sandwich.
MONICA: Joey, update the board.
JOEY: Moving "Sandwich" to "In Progress".
CHANDLER: Moving "Will to live" to "Blocked".
RACHEL: Can we focus?

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: The API rate limit is hit.
CHANDLER: We’re too popular.
ROSS: We are being scraped by a bot.
PHOEBE: Hello bot. We come in peace.
JOEY: Ban the bot!
MONICA: IP blocked.
PHOEBE: You killed him.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: Why is this function 500 lines long?
ROSS: It handles all the edge cases.
CHANDLER: It handles the curvature of the earth.
JOEY: If you scroll fast, it looks like animation.
MONICA: Break it down! Helper functions!
CHANDLER: I’m afraid to touch it. It breathes.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

RACHEL: I need a dongle.
ROSS: USB-C or Thunderbolt?
RACHEL: The round one.
CHANDLER: They’re all roundish.
MONICA: I have a bag of dongles sorted by year of obsolescence.
JOEY: I just jam it in. If it fits, it sits.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

PHOEBE: I wrote a song about Java.
CHANDLER: Let’s hear it.
PHOEBE: "Public static void main... pain... pain..."
ROSS: It captures the verbosity perfectly.
JOEY: Do a rap about CSS next.
PHOEBE: "Float left, float right, nothing works, goodnight."

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: We are migrating to Kubernetes.
CHANDLER: Why?
MONICA: Because everyone else is.
ROSS: It offers superior orchestration.
CHANDLER: It offers superior headaches.
JOEY: Kuber-what-now?

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: The font size is too small.
ROSS: It is 12 pixels. Standard.
RACHEL: Make it 14.
JOEY: Make it 20. Huge.
MONICA: It breaks the grid layout!
CHANDLER: Make it random. Keep them guessing.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: Segfault.
CHANDLER: Core dumped.
ROSS: We are accessing memory we do not own.
PHOEBE: Communism code. Our memory.
JOEY: Just download more RAM.
MONICA: That’s not how it works!

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: I have been stuck on this bug for three days.
ROSS: Have you tried rubber duck debugging?
CHANDLER: I talked to the duck. The duck ignored me.
JOEY: I talked to a sandwich. It agreed with me.
PHOEBE: You need a crystal.
CHANDLER: I need a new career.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

MONICA: I achieved Inbox Zero.
CHANDLER: I have Inbox Infinity.
ROSS: You should use filters.
CHANDLER: I filter everything into "Trash".
JOEY: I don't have email. I just wait for people to yell at me.
RACHEL: We noticed.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

ROSS: Vim is superior to Emacs.
CHANDLER: Here we go.
ROSS: It is lightweight and modal!
MONICA: VS Code is better. It has extensions.
JOEY: I use Notepad.
ROSS: Get out of my apartment.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

RACHEL: Can we use blue for the button?
MONICA: Which blue? We have fifty shades of blue defined.
CHANDLER: Fifty Shades of Blue. Worst movie ever.
JOEY: The bright one. Like the sky.
ROSS: Sky blue varies depending on atmospheric scattering.
RACHEL: Just pick a blue!

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

CHANDLER: I am refactoring the authentication.
JOEY: Again?
CHANDLER: Security standards changed.
PHOEBE: I use face recognition. I look at the screen and say "It's me".
MONICA: That is not a security protocol.
PHOEBE: It works for my mirror.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: Deployment failed. Checksum mismatch.
ROSS: The artifact is corrupted.
CHANDLER: Like our souls.
JOEY: Can we just upload the zip file via FTP?
MONICA: No FTP! Never FTP!
RACHEL: Just email me the code, I’ll put it on the website.
ROSS: *Hyperventilates*

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: I found a comment in the code: "Do not touch. Magic."
ROSS: Who wrote it?
CHANDLER: Git blame says... it was me. 2018.
JOEY: Past Chandler was a wizard.
MONICA: Remove the magic. Explain the logic.
CHANDLER: The magic is gone. Now it’s just sad code.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

PHOEBE: It means the computer is sorry.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: We need to increase code coverage.
CHANDLER: I’ll write a test that asserts true is true.
MONICA: That counts as coverage but zero value!

PHOEBE: We should support it. Respect your elders.
MONICA: It is dead technology! Let it rest!

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: We need a blockchain strategy.
CHANDLER: Our strategy is to not have one.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

MONICA: I’m going to rewrite the scheduler.
CHANDLER: Don’t do it.

CHANDLER: It’s not a boyfriend, Monica. It’s a scheduler.

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

RACHEL: Why is my phone hot?
ROSS: You have 50 apps open in the background.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

MONICA: Who changed the linter rules?
JOEY: I turned off the squiggly lines. They were stressing me out.
MONICA: The squiggly lines are there to save you!
JOEY: They judge me, Monica. They judge my code.
ROSS: Without static analysis, we are savages.
CHANDLER: I prefer the silence of the void over the judgment of the linter.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

RACHEL: We need to hire a rockstar ninja developer.
CHANDLER: Please don't use those words.
ROSS: I am a 10x engineer.
CHANDLER: You write 10 times more bugs?

SCENE: MONICA'S APARTMENT

MONICA: The staging environment is down.
CHANDLER: I think I accidentally deleted the database.
MONICA: You what?

JOEY: I thought red meant fast.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

PHOEBE: My laptop is haunted.
ROSS: It is likely a virus.
PHOEBE: No, a ghost. It types "help me" in the console.
CHANDLER: That's the default placeholder text, Phoebe.
PHOEBE: It's a cry for help from the machine spirit.
MONICA: It's a UI component.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

RACHEL: Can we make the logo spin?

ROSS: That is a dictatorship, not consensus.

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING

CHANDLER: I'm blocked by the client.

SCENE: THE COFFEE BREAK

JOEY: I want to make a video game.
CHANDLER: You can't even make a loop.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: My code is compiling.
MONICA: So?
CHANDLER: So I can't work. I'm sword fighting with Joey.

CHANDLER: You're ruining the fun, Ross.

SCENE: THE WAR ROOM

MONICA: Memory leak in the image processor.
JOEY: It's leaking pixels.

MONICA: Clean the vents!
JOEY: Put it in the fridge.

SCENE: THE OFFICE

CHANDLER: I'm writing a script to automate my standup update.
ROSS: That defeats the purpose of the meeting.

CHANDLER: "Specifically working on the same thing as yesterday".

SCENE: THE STANDUP MEETING
